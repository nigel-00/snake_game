# Overview

I created the classic snake game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game consists of a snake like sprite that can move in all four directions and targets a fruit like sprite that when they collide the snake increases height and the fruit moves to aa different position 
in the screen. There is a scoreboard that increases when the snake collides with the fruit.  As the snake grows longer it makes it hard for it to survive becuase if its head collides either with its tail or any part of its body the game is over. I used object oriented programming to create different classes like the food class, the snake class, and the score board class to simplify my game. 

This software is mainly to demonstate use of 3rd party libraries like Tkinter and how they can be integrated with prigramming languages. Also this software is a way to demonstrate my understanding of object oriented programming and how to integrate python classes. I also wanted to re create a game I played so much growing up with friends and family.

# Development Environment

* Python 
* Tkinter
* Git/ GitHub 

I used the Python programming language and a library called Tkinter for graphics and other hig-level functionality.

# Future Work

* Add different levels and obstacles for the snake
* Add sound to the game
* Add extra sprites/ characters to the game.
